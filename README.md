![Quarterly Sprint](Project-QuarterlySprint.svg)Core Values
| Core Value | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| All in Flow | Teamwork/Big Picture Thinking - We are not just a software company. We are in the business of seamless solutions. Each decision we make has a cascading effect on our co-workers, our customers, and our company. We make decisions carefully and with the big picture in mind. |
| Untethered Imagination | Innovation/Problem Solving/Thinking Outside the Box - We are not just a software company. We are in the business of solving the unsolvable. The industry is buried in problems too big, too small, or too impossible to solve. We cut through those Gordian knots before our customers ever realize their hands were tied. |
| Comsensitive | Compassion/Empathy/Humor - We are not just a software company. We are in the business of people. We know what our customers go through every day to conduct their business. We know the unique challenges they face. And we handle those issues as if they're our own, because they are. |
| Taming Chaos | Grit/Tenacity/Relentless - We are not just a software company. We are in the business of breakthroughs. We push our partners beyond what they've known. To lead them, we need to be the tip of the spear and razor-sharp. |
| Smart About the Build | Mindful/Thoughtful/"Get It" - We are not just a software company. We are in the business of engagement. We are involved, from the top down, with our customers. We share success. We share innovations. We share attention to detail. We are the structure through which their business flows. |
| Trust the Left Guard | Trust/Reliability - We are not just a software company. We are in the business of trust. Our customers count on us to produce results. We count on our fellow team members to do the same. Accountability is never avoided. |
